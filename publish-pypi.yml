# MOVE ME: .github/workflows/publish.yml
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Maintainer instructions (manual step required):
# 1) Move this file to: .github/workflows/publish.yml
# 2) In your GitHub repository settings, add a repository secret named
#    PYPI_API_TOKEN that contains an API token generated from https://pypi.org
#    with scope to upload the 'snbtlib' project.
# 3) (Optional) Restrict who can trigger workflows on the main branch as desired.
#
# What this workflow does:
# - Builds an sdist and wheel for this package when commits are pushed/merged to main.
# - Publishes the built artifacts to PyPI using the PYPI_API_TOKEN secret.
# - Includes guardrails to only run on the canonical repo and avoid duplicate runs.
#
# You can also trigger it manually via the "Run workflow" button (workflow_dispatch).
